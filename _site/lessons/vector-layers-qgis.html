	              <h2 id="lesson-goals">Lesson Goals</h2>

<p>In this lesson you will learn how to create vector layers based on
scanned historical maps. In <a href="../lessons/googlemaps-googleearth">Intro to Google Maps and Google Earth</a>
you used vector layers and created attributes in Google Earth. We will
be doing the same thing in this lesson, albeit at a more advanced level,
using QGIS software.</p>

<p>Vector layers are, along with raster layers, one of the two basic types
of data structures that store data. Vector layers use the three basic
GIS features – lines, points, and polygons – to represent real-world
features in digital format. Points can be used to represent specific
locations, such as towns, buildings, events, etc. (the scale of your map
will determine what you represent as a point – in a map of a province, a
town would be a point, whereas in a map of a town, a building might be a
point). Lines can effectively represent features such as roads, canals,
railways, and so on. Polygons (effectively enclosed shapes with more
than a few sides) are used to represent more complex objects such as the
boundaries of a lake, country, or electoral riding (again, scale will
affect your choice – large buildings in a close-up map of a city might
be better represented as polygons than as points).</p>

<p>In this lesson you will be creating shapefiles (which are a type of
vector data) to represent the historical development of communities and
roads in Prince Edward Island. Each shapefile can be created as one of
the three types of features: line, point, polygon (though these features
can&rsquo;t be mixed within a shapefile) . Each feature you create in a
shapefile has a corresponding set of attributes, which are stored in an
attribute table. You will create features and learn how to modify them,
which involves not only the visual creation of the three types of
features, but also the modification of their attributes. To do so, we
will use the files from <a href="../lessons/qgis-layers">Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding Layers</a>
concerning Prince Edward Island.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Start by downloading the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nigmsq0gz4ashf2/PEI_HollandMap1798_compLZW.tif">PEI_Holland map</a> to the project folder:</p>

<p>Open the file you saved at the end of <a href="../lessons/qgis-layers">Installing QGIS 2.0 and Adding
Layers</a>. You should have the following layers in your Layers window:</p>

<ul>
<li>  PEI_placenames</li>
<li>  PEI_highway</li>
<li>  PEI HYDRONETWORK</li>
<li>  1935 inventory_region</li>
<li>  coastline_polygon</li>
<li>  PEI-CumminsMap1927</li>
</ul>

<p>Uncheck all of these layer except for PEI_placenames,
coastline_polygon and PEI_CumminsMap1927</p>

<p>We are now going to add a second historical map as a raster layer.</p>

</figure>

<ul>
<li>  under Layer on toolbar, choose Add Raster Layer (alternatively the
same icon you see next to &lsquo;Add Raster Layer&rsquo; can also be selected
from tool bar)</li>
<li>  find the file you have downloaded titled &#39;PEI_HollandMap1798&rsquo;</li>
<li>  you will be prompted to define this layer&rsquo;s coordinate system. In
the Filter box search for &#39;2291&rsquo; then in the box below select
&#39;NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince Edward Isl. Stereographic&rsquo;</li>
<li>  If you are not prompted to define the layer&rsquo;s coordinate system, you
need to change a setting. Click Settings and then Options. Click CRS
on the right hand menu and then choose &#39;Prompt for CRS&rsquo; from the
options below &#39;When a new layer is created, or when a layer is
loaded that has no CRS&rsquo;. Click OK. Remove the Holland Map (right
click on it and click Remove) and try adding it again. This time you
should be prompted for a CRS and you can select the NAD83 option
(see above).</li>
</ul>

<p>In previous steps you have selected and unselected layers in the Layers
window by checking and unchecking the boxes next to them. These layers
are organized in descending order of visibility – i.e. the layer at the
top is the top layer in your viewer window (provided it is selected).
You can drag the layers up and down in the Layer window to change the
order in which they will be visible on your viewing window. The
coastline_polygon raster layer is currently not visible because it is
below the PEI_HollandMap1798 and PEI_Cummins1927 layers. In general it
is best to keep vector layers above the raster layers.</p>

<p>Uncheck PEI_Cummins1927 so that the only layer you have remaining is
PEI_HollandMap1798. Note that the map appears crooked on the screen;
this is because it has already been georeferenced by the lesson writers
to match the GIS vector layers. Learn more about georeferencing in
<a href="../lessons/georeferencing-qgis">Georeferencing in QGIS 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>Returning to the New Vector Layer window, we are going to make some
attributes. To create the first attribute:</p>

<ul>
<li>  under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in
&#39;Settlement_Name&rsquo; (note that when working in databases you cannot
use empty spaces in names so the convention is to use underscores in
their place)</li>
<li>  click Add to attributes list</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we are going to create a second attribute:</p>

<ul>
<li>  under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in &#39;Year&rsquo;</li>
<li>  this time, we are going to change the Type to Whole Number</li>
<li>  click Add to attribute list</li>
</ul>

<p>For the third attribute:</p>

<ul>
<li>  under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in &ldquo;End_Year&rdquo;
(GIS is not always optimal for dealing with change over time, so in
some cases it is important to have a field to identify approximately
when something ceased to exist)</li>
<li>  change the Type again to Whole Number</li>
<li>  click Add to attribute list</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>  When you complete these three steps, finish creating this shapefile
by clicking OK on the bottom right of the New Vector Layer window. A
pops up – name it &#39;settlements&rsquo; and save it with your
other GIS files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that a layer called &#39;settlements&rsquo; now appears in your Layers
window. Relocate it above the raster layers.</p>

<p>Uncheck all layers except settlements. You will notice that your viewing
window is now blank as we have not created any data. We will now create
new data from both the <code>PEI_HollandMap 1798</code> and the
<code>PEI_CumminsMap1927</code> to show the increase in settlement between the late
18th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<ul>
<li>  we will begin with the more recent, and thus usually more accurate,
map. Reselect (i.e. check the boxes beside) coastline_polygon and
PEI_CumminsMap1927</li>
<li>  in your viewing window, zoom in to Charlottetown (hint:
Charlottetown is near the middle of the island on the south side, at
the confluence of three rivers)</li>
<li>  select settlements layer in Layers window</li>
<li>  on the menu bar, select Toggle Editing</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>  Your cursor now appears as a crosshair – point the crosshair at
Charlottetown (if you don&rsquo;t happen to know PEI&rsquo;s geography, you can
cheat by adding on the PEI_placenames layer) keeping it within the
modern day coastline, and click (digitization is always a compromise
between accuracy and functionality; depending on the quality of the
original map and the digitization, for most historical applications
extreme accuracy is not necessary).</li>
<li>  An Attributes window will appear. Leave id field blank (at time of
writing, QGIS appears to be making two id fields and this one is
unnecessary). In Settlement field, type in &#39;Charlottetown&rsquo;. In the
Year field type in 1764. Click OK</li>
</ul>

<p>We will now repeat the steps we took with Charlottetown for Montague,
Summerside, and Cavendish (again, you can find these locations by adding
the PEI_placenames layers). Find Montague on the map, select the 3 dot
feature button and click on Montague on the map. When the Attributes
window appears, input Montague and 1732 in the appropriate fields.
Repeat for Summerside (1876) and Cavendish (1790).</p>

<p>In the Layers window, unselect the PEI_CumminsMap1927 and select
PEI_HollandMap1798. We are now going to identify two settlements
(Princetown &amp; Havre-St-Pierre) that no longer exist.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To locate Princetown, look for Richmond Bay and Cape Aylebsury (on
the north coast to the west of Cavendish), here you will find
Princetown (shaded-in) near the boundary between the yellow and the
blue</p></li>
<li><p>If you look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Royalty,_Prince_Edward_Island">Wikipedia entry</a> for the city you will notice
that because of a shallow harbor, Princetown did not become a major
settlement. It was renamed in 1947 and later downgraded to a hamlet.
For this reason we will include 1947 as the end date for this
settlement.</p></li>
<li><p>With the crosshair click on Princetown. In the Attribute table that
appears, put Princetown in the Settlement field, put 1764 into the
Year field, and put 1947 into the End_Year. Click OK</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Double-click on settlements layer in the Layers window, choose
Labels tab at the top of the ensuing window. Click on the box beside
Display labels. In Field containing label select Year (if
necessary), change font size to 18.0, change Placement to Above
Left, and then click OK</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On the northern coast of Lot 39 between Britain&rsquo;s Pond and St. Peters
Bay, we will now put a dot for the location of a long lost village
called Havre-St-Pierre.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Havre-St-Pierre was the island&rsquo;s first Acadian settlement but has
been uninhabited since the Acadian deportation of 1758.</p></li>
<li><p>With the crosshair click on Havre-St. Pierre. In the Attribute table
that appears, put Havre-St-Pierre in the Settlement field, put 1720
into the Year field, and put 1758 into the End_Year. Click OK</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We will now now create another vector layer – this layer will be a line
vector. Click Layer -&gt; New -&gt; New Shapefile Layer. The New Vector
Layer window will appear (in the Type category at the top, select Line)</p>

<ul>
<li>  Click the Specify CRS button, and select NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince
Edward Isl. Stereographic (EPSG: 2291), and then click OK</li>
<li>  under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in &#39;Road_Name&rsquo;</li>
<li>  click Add to attributes list</li>
</ul>

<p>Create a second attribute</p>

<ul>
<li>  under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in Year</li>
<li>  change the Type to Whole Number</li>
<li>  click Add to attribute list</li>
<li>  To finish creating this shapefile, click OK on the bottom right of
the New Vector Layer window. A &#39;save&rsquo; screen pops up – name it
&#39;roads&rsquo; and save it with your other GIS files.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are now going to trace the roads from the 1798 map so that we can
compare them to the modern roads. Make that you have the
PEI_Holland1798 and settlements layers checked in the Layers window.
Select road layer in the layers window, select Toggle Editing on the top
toolbar, and then select Add Feature</p>

<ul>
<li>  We can see that some of these roads correspond closely to modern
roads, while others do not at all correspond. It would take further
historical research to determine whether this is simply because the
Holland map did not sufficiently survey roads at the time, or if
roads have changed considerably since then.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now create a third type of vector layer: a polygon vector. Click Layer
-&gt; New -&gt; New Shapefile Layer. The New Vector Layer window will appear
– in the Type category at the top, select Polygon</p>

<ul>
<li>  Click the Specify CRS button, and select NAD83(CSRS98) / Prince
Edward Isl. Stereographic (EPSG: 2291), and then click OK</li>
<li>  under New attribute, in the field beside Name, type in &#39;lot_name&rsquo;
in the field beside Year</li>
<li>  click Add to attributes list</li>

<p>Start by creating a polygon for lot 66, which is the only rectangular
lot on the island</p>

<ul>
<li>  Click on Toggle Editing on top tool bar, and then click on Add
Feature</li>
<li>  click on all four corners of lot 66 and you will see a polygon
created</li>
<li>  right-click on the final corner and an Attributes window will
appear. Add 66 to lot_names field and add 1764 (the year these lots
were surveyed) to the Year field</li>
</ul>

<p>We are now going to trace lot 38, which is just west of Havre-St-Pierre.
Make sure that there is a check mark in the box beside
PEI_HollandMap1798 layer in the Layers window</p>

<p>Click on Toggle Editing on top tool bar, and then click on Add Feature</p>

<p>Trace the outline of Lot 38, which is more difficult because of the
coastline, as accurately as possible. In order to show you the Snap
feature, we want you to trace along the modern coastline (snapping is
an automatic editing operation that adjusts the feature you have drawn
to coincide or lineup exactly with the coordinates and shape of another
nearby feature)</p>

<ul>
<li>  select Settings-&gt; Snapping Options</li>
</ul>

<li>  a Snapping options window will open: click on the box beside
coastal_polygon, for the Mode category select &ldquo;to vertex and
segment&rdquo;, for Tolerance select 10.0, and for Units select &#39;pixels&rsquo;.
Click OK</li>

<p>Make sure that the lots layer is selected in Layers window, and select
Add Feature from the tool bar</p>

<ul>
<li>  with your cursor click on the two bottom corners of your polygon
just as you did with Lot 38. At the coastline you will notice that
you have a collection of lines to trace around Savage Harbour. This
is where the Snapping features becomes helpful. As you work to trace
along the modern coastline it will significantly improve your
accuracy by snapping your clicks directly on top of the existing
line. The more clicks you make the more accurate it will be, but
keep in mind that for many HGIS purposes obtaining extreme accuracy
sometimes produces diminishing returns.</li>

<p>When you finish tracing and creating the polygon, select and deselect
the various layers you have created, comparing and seeing what
relationships you can deduce.</p>

<p>In Google Earth there were limitations on the types of features,
attributes, and data provided by Google, and Google Earth did much of
the work for you. That is fine when you are learning or want to quickly
create maps. The advantage of using QGIS software to create new vector
layers is that you have a great deal of freedom and control over the
types of data you can use and the features and attributes that you can
create. This in turn means that you can create custom maps far beyond
what can be achieved in Google Earth or Google Maps Engine Lite. You
have seen this firsthand with the points, lines, and polygons vector
layers you learned how to create in this lesson. If you found data on,
for example, public health records in the 18th century, you could create
a new layer to work with what you already created showing the
distribution of typhoid outbreaks and see if there are correlations with
major roads and settlements. Moreover, GIS software allows you to not
only spatially represent and present data in much more sophisticated
ways, but to analyze and create new data in ways that aren&rsquo;t possible
otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>You have learned how to create vector layers. Make sure you save your
work!</strong></p>
